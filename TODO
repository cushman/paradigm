To do:

now:
- client side templating
- DB support: client and server interfaces. Couch to start?

later:
- minify JS being sent to the client (try UglifyJS, is node)
- recursive template parsing
- saying "Done!" is massively deceptive
- use coffeescript compiler library for compilation instead of command-line

much later:
- parse template files for shared functions
- add a dev environment that:
    - watches the server files and reloads them automatically
    - issues a client-side hook that watches the server for updates and refreshes
    - doesn't compile client-side code, issues a client-side cs compiler instead
    - (or just doesn't minify)
    - uses paperboy to serve static files
    - ...
- hold template files in memory, remove paperboy except in dev
